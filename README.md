## 🔄 How It Works

The rankings are automatically updated daily via GitHub Actions:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches certification data from Credly API for all countries worldwide
   - Collects GitHub certifications from official GitHub organization badges
   - Includes Microsoft-issued GitHub certifications (migrated from GitHub in 2024)
   - Uses parallel processing for fast data retrieval
   - Optimized handling for large countries (India, USA, Brazil, UK)
   
2. **Smart Filtering**: Ensures ranking accuracy
   - **Expired certifications are automatically excluded** from counts
   - Only valid (non-expired) certifications count toward rankings
   - Top 30 candidates per country are validated for accurate results
   - 96% reduction in API requests with intelligent candidate selection
   
3. **Company Information**: Enriches rankings with professional context
   - Company data fetched from public Credly user profiles
   - Displayed alongside name and certification count in rankings
   - Updated during ranking generation for top performers only
   
4. **Data Storage**: All certification data in the `datasource/` directory
   - Individual CSV files per country (e.g., `github-certs-brazil.csv`)
   - Metadata tracking for update timestamps and optimization
   
5. **Ranking Generation**: Creates TOP 10 rankings for each region
   - Regional rankings: Brazil, Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania
   - Global ranking with top performers worldwide
   - Automatic markdown file updates with latest data

### ℹ️ GitHub Certifications Sources

This project tracks **ALL GitHub certifications** from two sources:

1. **GitHub Organization Badges** - All certifications issued directly by GitHub on Credly
   - **Core Certifications**: Foundations, Actions, Advanced Security, Administration, Copilot
   - **Partner Credentials**: Migrations, AzureDevOps Migrations, Advanced Security Partner Delivery
   - **Sales Badges**: FY26 Sales Professional, Revenue Motions, Platform, Copilot, etc.
   - **Professional Badges**: Tech Sales Professional, Sales Professional
   - **Any other badge** issued by the GitHub organization
   
2. **Microsoft-Issued Badges** - GitHub certifications transitioned to Microsoft Learn
   - GitHub Foundations (Microsoft Certified)
   - Other GitHub certifications now issued via learn.microsoft.com

> **Note**: All badges from the GitHub organization on Credly are counted, not just the core certifications. As of 2024, GitHub migrated some certification issuance to Microsoft Learn.

### 🎓 Microsoft Learn Integration

This project now supports tracking GitHub certifications from **Microsoft Learn** transcripts, including:

**Certifications (with exam numbers):**
- **GH-100**: GitHub Administration
- **GH-200**: GitHub Actions  
- **GH-300**: GitHub Copilot
- **GH-400**: GitHub Advanced Security Partner
- **GH-500**: GitHub Advanced Security

**Applied Skills Assessments:**
- [Accelerate app development by using GitHub Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/applied-skills/accelerate-app-development-by-using-github-copilot/)

#### How to Link Your MS Learn Profile

To have your Microsoft Learn GitHub certifications counted in the rankings:

1. **Go to your MS Learn profile**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/me/transcript
2. **Click "Share link"** to create a share URL for your transcript
3. **Copy the share link** (it looks like: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/YOUR-NAME/transcript/share/SHARE_ID`)
4. **Submit a PR** to update your entry in the appropriate country CSV file in the `datasource/` directory:
   - Add your share URL to the `mslearn_url` column
   - Example row: `Jesse,Houwing,6,/users/jessehouwing/badges,https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jessehouwing-1848/transcript/share/d5gza1z690gp607`

> **Privacy Note**: The transcript share link only exposes your completed certifications and training, not personal account details.

#### MVP Badge

Users with a linked MS Learn profile who have the **Microsoft MVP** affiliation will automatically receive an MVP badge <img src="images/mvp.svg" alt="Microsoft MVP" width="16" height="16"/> next to their name in the rankings. MVP status is detected automatically from the MS Learn profile API.

### 🎯 Ranking Accuracy

- **Expiration Filtering**: Only active, non-expired certifications are counted
- **Automatic Validation**: Certification expiration dates are checked against current date
- **Example**: A user with 15 total badges but 3 expired will show 12 valid certifications
- **Daily Updates**: Rankings refresh daily to reflect newly issued and expired certifications

## 🚀 Manual Execution
