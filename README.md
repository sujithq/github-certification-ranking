## 🔄 How It Works

The rankings are automatically updated daily via GitHub Actions:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches certification data from Credly API for all countries worldwide
   - Collects GitHub certifications from official GitHub organization badges
   - Includes Microsoft-issued GitHub certifications (migrated from GitHub in 2024)
   - Uses parallel processing for fast data retrieval
   - Optimized handling for large countries (India, USA, Brazil, UK)
   
2. **Fair Ranking Criteria**: Ensures an equitable competition
   - **Position-based ranking**: The ranking shows 10 positions, not 10 users — professionals with the same number of certifications share the same position
   - **Expired certifications are excluded**: Only active, valid certifications count
   - **Excluded certifications**: Badges that can no longer be earned (e.g., `GitHub Sales Professional`) are excluded to keep the competition fair
   - **Duplicate prevention**: Same badge name counts only once per user
   - Top 50 candidates per country are validated for accurate results
   
3. **Multi-dimensional Rankings**: Each regional ranking includes
   - 🏆 **Top 10 Professionals** — Individual ranking by certification count
   - 🏢 **Top 5 Companies** — Companies with the most certified professionals in the region
   - 🌐 **Top 5 Countries** — Countries leading in certifications (excluded for single-country rankings)
   
4. **Company Information**: Enriches rankings with professional context
   - Company data fetched from public Credly user profiles
   - Displayed alongside name and certification count in rankings
   
5. **Data Storage**: All certification data in the `datasource/` directory
   - Individual CSV files per country (e.g., `github-certs-brazil.csv`)
   - Metadata tracking for update timestamps and optimization

### ℹ️ GitHub Certifications Sources

This project tracks GitHub certifications from two sources:

1. **GitHub Organization Badges** - Certifications issued directly by GitHub on Credly
   - **Core Certifications**: Foundations, Actions, Advanced Security, Administration, Copilot
   - **Partner Credentials**: Migrations, AzureDevOps Migrations, Advanced Security Partner Delivery
   - **Any other active badge** issued by the GitHub organization
   
2. **Microsoft-Issued Badges** - GitHub certifications transitioned to Microsoft Learn
   - GitHub Foundations, Actions, Advanced Security, Administration, Copilot (Microsoft Certified)
   - Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert
   - Microsoft Applied Skills related to GitHub

> **Note**: As of 2024, GitHub migrated some certification issuance to Microsoft Learn. Certifications that can no longer be earned (e.g., `GitHub Sales Professional`) are excluded from rankings to ensure fair competition.

### 🎯 Ranking Fairness

- **Position-based**: 10 positions shown — tied professionals share the same rank
- **Active only**: Expired certifications are automatically excluded
- **Excluded badges**: Certifications no longer available for earning are not counted
- **Daily Updates**: Rankings refresh daily to reflect newly issued and expired certifications

## 🚀 Manual Execution

You can manually trigger the rankings generation:

1. Go to the [Actions tab](../../actions)
2. Select "Generate GitHub Certifications Rankings"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## 💻 Local Execution

### Fetch Data for a Specific Country

```bash
# Fetch data for a single country
python3 fetch_country.py "Brazil"
python3 fetch_country.py "United States"
```

### Fetch Data for All Countries

```bash
# Fetch all countries in parallel
python3 fetch_data.py
```

### Fetch Large Countries (Optimized)

```bash
# For countries with thousands of certified users
python3 fetch_large_country.py "India"
python3 fetch_large_country.py "United States"
```

### Generate Rankings

```bash
# Generate all regional and global rankings
python3 generate_rankings.py
```

### Find Missing Certifications for a Person

Use a Credly username or public profile URL:

```bash
python3 find_missing_certs.py "hezekiah-ogundele"
python3 find_missing_certs.py "https://www.credly.com/users/hezekiah-ogundele/badges"
```

The command compares the person's active certifications with
`certification_catalog.json`, which is refreshed whenever rankings are generated.
The catalog includes core, partner, sales, and allowed Microsoft-issued credentials,
so a listed credential may not be available to every person.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Data Source
Data is sourced from the [Credly API](https://www.credly.com/api/v1/directory) for GitHub certifications.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Intelligent Candidate Selection**: Fetches detailed badge data only for top 50 candidates per country
  - Reduces API requests by ~95% for large countries
- **Parallel Processing**: Fetches multiple countries simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Metadata Tracking**: Skips recently updated countries to reduce unnecessary API calls
- **Specialized Handlers**: Large countries use optimized parallel page fetching
- **Smart Caching**: CSV files stored with timestamps for efficient updates

### Certification Validation
- **Expiration Checking**: Each badge's `expires_at_date` is validated against current date
- **Dual Source Tracking**: Combines GitHub org badges + Microsoft external badges
- **Excluded Badges**: Certifications no longer available (e.g., `GitHub Sales Professional`) are excluded via `EXCLUDED_BADGES`
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Only unique badge names are counted (no duplicates)
- **Top Performer Focus**: Detailed validation applied to top 50 candidates per country

### Regional Coverage
- **Americas**: 30+ countries including Brazil, USA, Canada, Argentina, Mexico, etc.
